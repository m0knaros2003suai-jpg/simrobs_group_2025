1. Look in the [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MFO6x2WuOzIZvYZm08gwcFw2lOKu-bSqmNkslq-nyiA/edit?usp=sharing) and find yourself:

3. Look in the "Integrators.ipynb" file and use these functions for your task.
4. Solve analytically the ODE in the form of:
   
$a \cdot \ddot{x} + b \cdot \dot{x} + c \cdot x = d$

4. From the list take coefficients of your ODE and solve them with three integrators: Explicit/Implicit Euler, Rung-Kutta methods.
5. Compare results of these methods with analytical solution, dicsuss and conclude your thoughts in the .pdf report.
6. Name of the report should be "Your_ISU_number_YourName_task1.pdf"
